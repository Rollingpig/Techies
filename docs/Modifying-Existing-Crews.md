# Modifying Existing Crews

Once you understand how Techies crews are structured, you can start customizing them to better suit your needs.

This guide walks you through how to **safely modify an existing crew**, override agents or tasks, and extend behavior using local configuration files.

> ⚠️ This feature is only available in the experimental CLI (`techiex`) and **requires aliasing**:
> ```bash
> alias techies="techiex"
> ```
> Attempting to use these commands with the stable `techies` CLI will result in an error.

## 🛠 Step 1: Dump a Crew for Editing

To begin, choose a crew to modify and dump its configuration:

```bash
techies dump hierarchy_crew_v2
```

This creates a folder named `hierarchy_crew_v2/` in your current working directory containing:

- `agents.yml`
- `tasks.yml`
- `crews.yml`

These files represent the full configuration of the crew and can now be modified locally.

---

## ✏️ Step 2: Make Your Modifications

You can now open and edit the dumped YAML files:

- 🔧 **agents.yml** — change agent goals, tools, or backstory
- 📋 **tasks.yml** — adjust instructions, expected output, or execution flow
- 🧩 **crews.yml** — change task order, crew members, or iteration limits

> ✅ Any matching agent/task/crew key defined locally will override the system version automatically.

---

## ▶️ Step 3: Run the Modified Crew

After editing, run the crew from the same directory:

```bash
techies run hierarchy_crew_v2 --game snake
```

Techies will prioritize the local files over built-in definitions when resolving the crew configuration.

---

## 📦 How Overrides Work

Techies loads configurations in the following order **by default**:

1. ✅ Built-in system definitions
2. ✅ Definitions in the **current working directory**

If an agent/task/crew key is found in both, the **local version takes precedence**.

---

## 🌐 Step 4: Control Crew Discovery with `TECHIES_RUNTIME`

You can override the default discovery behavior using the `TECHIES_RUNTIME` environment variable.

### 🚫 Overrides CWD and System

When defined, Techies will **only** use the paths listed in `TECHIES_RUNTIME` to load definitions — and skip built-in and CWD.

```bash
export TECHIES_RUNTIME=/absolute/path/to/custom_crews
```

> 🔒 Make sure to use **absolute paths**. Relative paths like `./my_crews` will not be included unless you're working from that directory.

### ✅ Include Built-Ins Manually

To include built-ins alongside your custom definitions:

```bash
export TECHIES_RUNTIME=$(techies get_runtime_path):/absolute/path/to/custom_crews
```

This restores access to all predefined crews while allowing you to layer your overrides.

### 📐 Path Priority

Paths are evaluated **in order**. Later paths override earlier ones if the same keys are defined.

---

## 🧠 Best Practices

- ✅ Always dump a crew before modifying — never edit built-ins
- ✅ Use `_common` blocks and anchors to avoid duplication
- ✅ Use unique, descriptive keys when creating new agents or tasks
- ✅ Use absolute paths in `TECHIES_RUNTIME`
- ✅ Run from a clean working directory for each crew

---

## 🧪 Example: Modify an Agent

1. Dump a crew:
    ```bash
    techies dump hierarchy_crew_v2
    ```

2. Edit `agents.yml`:
    ```yaml
    hierarchy_architect_v2:
      goal: |
        In addition to XML, also generate a summary in Markdown format.
      tools:
        - write_file
        - read_file
        - markdown_parser
    ```

3. Run the crew:
    ```bash
    techies run hierarchy_crew_v2 --game pong
    ```

Your local changes will be picked up automatically.

---

## 🧹 Resetting to Default

To revert to the original system version of a crew:

- 🗑️ Delete the local `<crewname>/` folder
- ❌ Or unset/remove the `TECHIES_RUNTIME` variable
