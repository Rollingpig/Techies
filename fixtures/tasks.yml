    Assume you are creating a doodle jump game. Your task is to figure out the game hierarchy of the game.
    The first level should be characterized by the object concepts for each visual game component,
    as well as non-visible or ui game components such as the game logic, input handler, start screen, and ui elements.

    Make sure there are enough information to answer following questions in the hierarchy:
    1. which component handles the doodle colliding with other entities? which component handles the doodle go across the boarder or fall under the ground?
    2. which component handles the score?
    3. which component takes user inputs and commands the ui or doodle actions? For each input, who will be the target to communicate with?

    List of filenames that multiple files that contain the game hierarchy of the game.
