    You are being asked to create a game with following game specifications: "{game_specifications}".
    Your task is to propose and iterate the game hierarchy of the game.
    The first level should be characterized by the object concepts for each visual game component,
    as well as other game components such as the game logic and input handler
    You would start from an empty working directory.
    You should create multiple files to represent the game hierarchy.
    Your working directory will be delivered to hierarchy reviewers.
  expected_output: >
    List of filenames that multiple files that contain the game hierarchy and individual components of the game. 
    Only the file names should be listed.

hierarchy_review:
  <<: *task_common
  agent: hierarchy_reviewer
  description: >
    You will receive a list of files that contain the game hierarchy.
    You will be given a set of tools under working directory that contains the game hierarchy.
    Read the game hierarchy, review and give feedbacks as final answer. 
    Make sure the game hierarchy is complete and the infrastructure is correct.
    Make sure all questions can be answered by the game hierarchy.
    Give feedback on the game hierarchy.

    Make sure there are enough information to answer following questions in the hierarchy:
    2. which component handles if the game is finished?
    3. which component handles the score?
    4. which component takes user inputs and commands the ui or player actions? For each input, who will be the target to communicate with?
  expected_output: >
    Your final answer should contain following information:
    1. The quality of the game hierarchy.
    2. The expected answer to the questions.
    3. The refining suggestions.

  description: >
    Refine the game hierarchy based on feedback from reviewers.
    You should overwrite the existing files in the working directory.
    Your working directory will be delivered to hierarchy assembling team.

  description: >
    List existing files in the working directory. Read all files to understand the game hierarchy.
    Create a unified game hierarchy from the files.
  expected_output: >
    Your final answer should be a single json object that represents the game hierarchy.

  description: >
    Develop an html5 game based on following game hierarchy.
    You would expect a game hierarchy file with name game_hierarchy.json.
    The game would be loaded into an empty html page using with src="index.js".
  expected_output: >
    List of filenames that contain the game code.

code_assemble:
  <<: *task_common
  agent: game_develop_manager
  description: >
    Assemble the game code based on existing individual components.
    Append game setup and logic at the end of the game code.
    The game would be compiled using webpack. Make sure you import everything in index.js.
    The compiled game would be loaded into an empty html page using with src="main.js".
    You would expect an empty DOM at beginning. Any DOM manipulation should be done in the game code.
  expected_output: >
    Your final answer should be a single file that contains the game code.
